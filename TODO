* `konanc` and `kotlinc`
** same binaries
** does not show usage if no parameters specified
** does not line `--help` but `-help`
** downloads packages from the internet, no matter I downloadede the compiler
   may not work good for ones who downloads the compiler to try in plan/travel
** takes seconds to parse commandline arguments

* `mackbook` platform name looks weird, `macOS X` is the official name
